The script outputs a gcode file to make a snowflake on a MakerBot.  Some settings are hardcoded.

The code is pretty rough, but you get can something that works by using the following method:

1. Generate a star using the para_snowflake.py file.

2. Prepend the outputted snowflake.gcode file with the raft etc found in the header.gcode file.

3. Send to makerbot!
