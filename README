My additions are the para_star* files.  The goal being to generate randomized snowflakes.

The code is pretty rough, but you get can something that works by using the following method:

1. Generate a star using the para_star_polyline.py file.

2. Prepend the outputted test.gcode file with the raft etc found in the header.gcode file.

3. Send to makerbot!
